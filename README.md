BOMB DIFFUSAL GAME.

This is a game that assigns a random number (1-12) to four individual buttons that are then used used to try and match a randomly generated target number (19-120).

Wins, Losses, and Fastest Time are all captured and displayed to user.

If player completes first game.
They then move on to level 2 which is entierly the same as game level 1 but the timer is lessend to 01:00. (down from 01:30).

If player completes second game.
They then move on to level 2 which is entierly the same as game level 1 but the timer is lessend to 00:30. (down from 01:00lvl2 / 1:30lvl1).

If player completes thrid game.
There are no more displayed levels to complete.
User may chose to play as many more times as they like, but level 1 time values will always be used.

Also upon level 3 completion.
"Bonus Level" button will appear.
If "Bonus Level" button is clicked the game will start withe level 1 timer values but with a little twist.
Every time you click a button THAT button will choose 1 of the 4 button locations and move to that location.

Note: (thought about randomly assiging z-index as well values but decided I liked the game dynamic better with the default fixed Layers for the buttons'Blue 1 (back layer), green 2, red 3, yellow 4 (front layer)'
